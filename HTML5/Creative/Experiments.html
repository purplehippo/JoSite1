			<p>
				I am a developer mainly for web applications, but also analyse business requirements, and write functional specifications. I have eight years experience - four in an airline, three in an insurance company and one for a student travel group. I started writing web applications with Classic ASP, then moved to ASP.NET. My experience includes multi-tier applications, with business objects, data access layers, the front end and web services; I also have responsibility for database design and test data.
			</p><p>
				I have worked independently for complete development life-cycles - from gathering requirements, through development, to test, integration and user support. More recently, I have been a member of a team working on all tiers of a large .NET web project; also included gathering requirements for a functional specification
			</p><p>
				My most recent experience uses VB.net, but my background is C#. The main technologies used at work are:
				.NET (VB and C# using Visual Studio)
				MSSQL/T-SQL
				AJAX
				LINQ
				HTML/CSS/XHTML
				Javascript
				jQuery
				XML/XSL (FOP) for dynamic PDF generation
				I have used LINQ, generics, written AJAX components, a Java web service, JSON and write documentation. I have also been involved in UAT phases and making design/development changes accordingly.
				These have been often supported by third party tools, including:
				Telerik (OpenAccess)
				CodeSmith
				AjaxControlToolkit
				I am also studying courses in Java, Python and database development; and am developing an Android application (Android development) for bellringing.
