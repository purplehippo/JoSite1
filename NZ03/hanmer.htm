            <h2>HANMER SPRINGS day</h2>

            <p>
    	        James (seen below at Lake Tekapo) bravely took me for a ride in his car to Hanmer Springs (bravely because I had to drive back!).

            Stopping at Kaiapoi, this is the oldest working steamer in NZ. The Tuhoe.
            <br />
            Built in 1919 in Auckland. It became a fishing vessel in 1963, but declared unseaworthy, laid up at Kaiapoi and converted into a floating art gallery and hand-craft exhibition centre.
            <br />
            In 1981, the vessel was restored. At present it is owned by the M.V.Tuhoe Preservation Society. The Tuhoe runs cruises on the Kaiapoi and Waimakariri Rivers.

            Obviously, an 'A Class' no 428. Mmmmm. There was a very chatty man here. Told us loads and loads and loads and .... of stuff. Very helpful if we had all day.
            <br />
            From their website, <a href="http://www.wekapassrailway.co.nz">Weka Pass Railway</a>, this A class 428 was built for New Zealand Rail in Thames, New Zealand in 1909. It ran on the main trunk line, mainly on express trains. The engine was saved from the scrap heap in the 1960's. This is one of only two in existence (and the only one in working steam condition).

            This wound JV up!! :-)  I mentioned that it would be funny to book him a bungee jump. When we approached Hanmer, there were signs for it, so I asked him to pull over. It was made very clear that no bungy jumping would be taking place!!. All I wanted was a piccie from the bridge!. It was funny though :-)

		    This is the one thing we found to do in the over hyped (my opinion) Hanmer Springs. It's called Conical Hill and it took us just over 1/2 an hour to climb to this view at the top.

            JV. A frozen 20-something, out on a sight-seeing trip. Preserved by the status of Tenterden Town  ;-)
