            <h2>Outline of my CV</h2>A copy of my CV is available here: <a href="Files/cvJoFaircloth_Apr12.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.


<h2>Work history</h2>
<div class="contentBox">
    <p>
        I am a <b>developer</b> mainly for web applications, but also <b>analyse</b> business requirements, and write functional specifications.  I have <b>eight </b> years experience – four in an airline, three in an insurance company and one for a student travel group.  I started writing web applications with Classic ASP, then moved to ASP.NET.  My experience includes <b>multi-tier applications</b>, with business objects, data access layers, the front end and web services; I also have responsibility for database design and test data.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have worked independently for complete development life-cycles – from gathering requirements, through development, to test, integration and user support.  More recently, I have been a member of a team working on all tiers of a large .NET web project; also included gathering requirements for a functional specification
    </p>
    <p>
        My most recent experience uses VB.net, but my background is C#.  The main technologies used at work are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>.NET (VB and C# using Visual Studio)</li>
        <li>MSSQL/T-SQL</li>
        <li>AJAX</li>
        <li>LINQ</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS/XHTML</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
        <li>XML/XSL (FOP) for dynamic PDF generation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have used LINQ, generics, written AJAX components, a Java web service, JSON and write documentation.  I have also been involved in UAT phases and making design/development changes accordingly.</p>
    <p>These have been often supported by third party tools, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Telerik (OpenAccess)</li>
        <li>CodeSmith</li>
        <li>AjaxControlToolkit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I am also studying courses in <b>Java</b>, <b>Python</b> and <b>database development</b>; and am developing an Android application (<a href="android.htm">Android development</a>) for bellringing.
    </p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<div class="contentBox">
    <p>
        I graduated from Loughborough University in 2001, with a BEng with honours in Electronic and Electrical Engineering; and, after a one year placement with an engineering company I also have a Diploma in Industrial Studies (DIS).
    </p>
    <p>
        I am continuing my studies (for fun!) with <a href="ou.htm">The Open University</a>, in order to gain a BSc(hons) Open with computing and astronomy. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I have also started the courses offered by <a href="udacity.htm">Udacity</a> - so far, CS101 - Building a Search Engine, with <b>Python</b>.
    </p>

<h2>Soft skills and interests</h2>
<div class="contentBox">
    <p>
        As a keen bellringer and responsible for ringers and ringing at St Swithun's, East Grinstead, I often explain concepts and new methods to others. I also sit on the committees of the Sussex Northern Division and East Grinstead and District Guild (EGDG).
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a regular volunteer at the <a href="http://www.bluebell-railway.co.uk/" target="_blank">Bluebell Railway</a>.  The <a href="http://www.maunsell.org.uk/" target="_blank">Maunsell Locomotive Society</a> base 5 engines there, and we are currently overhauling our S15 (no. 847).  I am a company director of the MLS.</p>
    <p>
        I worked and <a href="NZ03/nz_index.htm">travelled</a> in New Zealand 2002-2003.  I worked as a Junior Engineer, helping design the front end of a colour display unit - this was a superb insight into the running of international projects in an engineering environment, as well as integrating with New Zealand life and culture.  The work included both hardware design and test, and creating (organising) a components database with Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a cheerful, bubbly person with a good eye for detail.  I work well independently and in a team, and interact well with many types of people.  My eagerness to be involved and ability to communicate well is reflected by my directorship and committee posts.
