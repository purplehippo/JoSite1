            <h2>NEW ZEALAND</h2>
            <p>
    	        This was the beginning of my Magic Bus ride to Wellington. I left the YHA at 8.30 (and unlike some, I was even on the correct bus). It's kind of a free-for-all chuck your bags in the back and find a seat. It was fairly quiet, which was nice.
            </p>
    	    <img src="images/aucklandview.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Ackland" />
            The top of Mt Something. This is Auckland. You can see the Huraki Golf, the harbour bridge, the Sky Tower and downtown Auckland to the right.
		    <img src="images/maori.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Maori at the hangi" />
            Stopping in Rotorua we all went to a Hangi (where Maori jump around and stick out their tongues in a 'traditional' (for the cameras) way). Customs are expected to be upheld (unless you work for the press or have a camera). Anyways, there was huge amounts of food, and it was a really good night out.

            A geyser at Rotorua.
		    <img src="images/mtdoom2.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Mount Doom" />
            This Mount Ruapehu, or Mount Doom (for those who understand)  :-)
            <img src="images/weltram.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="The Wellington tram" />
            Wellington's hill and cable car.
            <br /><br />
            I then took the ferry, after waiting around for the wind to dye down for 3 days, to Picton, on the South Island.
            <br /><br />
		    These images should have a page of their own , but for the moment, they're here.
            <img src="images/plane.jpg" width="288" height="384" alt="Richard Pearce's plane at Pleasant Point" />
            This plane (don't ask how long it took JV to find it!) is located just outside of Pleasant Point. It is supposedly an imitation of Richard Pearce's plane, which 'flew' before the Write brothers' and recently had its 100 years celebration.
		    <img src="images/pukakijv.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Lake Pukaki" />
            Lake Pukaki (the same as in Mount Cook) - just here for a look at the colour!.
            <img src="images/bushtrain.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Bush train at Ferrymead Historic Park" />
            A bush train at Ferrymead Historic Park (I don't think it really counts as a real train??)
            <img src="images/train.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="The tourist train over the pass (or to Picton)" />
            This was just passing. It's the passenger train for the day (I came to Chch on this)  :-)
            <img src="images/trambridge.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="A Christchurch tram on a bridge over the Avon" />
