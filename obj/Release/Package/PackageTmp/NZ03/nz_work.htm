            Looks like I'm about to dig a hole, eh?. Funny that!. That's David and Tom in the background.

            This was just <b>the</b> best shot of mine of the day. It was FANTASTIC, it went further than all the other 5 boys', and also unlike theirs, it landed in the right direction too. YAY. :-)

            Munchies after the golf. Prizes were given out, I got a boobie prize, because I was the only one left without one! :-)
