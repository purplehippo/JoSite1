            <h2>The WEST COAST and GLACIERS</h2>
		    <p>
                Again leaving at 7am, we left a cloudy, misty Christchurch for the glorious (unusually) West Coast. Here are a few, select images of the trip. I'll put more information up as and when I can :-)
		    </p>
		
            <img src="images/mist.jpg" width="384" height="288">
            First thing in the morning, just coming up to the foothills. The reason we stopped was the natural 'Stonehenge' lookalike on the other side of the road - this photo was better though!  :-)
            <img border="0" src="images/fall.jpg" width="288" height="384" />
            This was our short hike for the day - 1hr return, up. At one of the three main mountain passes in NZ - Arthur's Pass (after Arthur Dobson), just near to the summit of 980m. This waterfall is 131m (363') high. Being us, we got very wet, trying to take photos!.
            <img border="0" src="images/steam.jpg" width="384" height="288" />
            The second steam train I've seen 'going' in this country (though I'm not sure the bush train counts). Pathetic, eh?. I think the picture's to size.
            <img border="0" src="images/kea.jpg" width="415" height="410" />
		    Keas are very clever - they'll have your lunch. They've even been known to take out the seal from around your car windscreen, so they can get at your food!. This one seen running away from me - I didn't have any food (see it checking over its shoulder!?).
            <img border="0" src="images/trainCarBridge.jpg" width="384" height="288" />
            Look out for the train :-)  This is a single lane, rail and road bridge - it's quite long too. 
            See how it helpfully puts the 'Give Way' line across the railway line.
            <img border="0" src="images/dolphin.jpg" width="288" height="384" />
            Greymouth. Where we got munched by sand flies. This is a dolphin, I thought it looked funky.
            <img border="0" src="images/lakePalm.jpg" width="384" height="288" />
            I think this is Lake Ianthe... - amazing, eh.
            <img border="0" src="images/matheson.jpg" width="384" height="288" />
            Lake Matheson, the most photographed lake in NZ. Don't understand why. Mount Cook is reflected here, from the other side to last week's photos.
            <img border="0" src="images/hay.jpg" width="288" height="384" />
            Mount Cook again, behind the Smiley hay bales.
            <img border="0" src="images/franz2.jpg" width="384" height="288" />
            Franz Joseph Glacier - it was melting whilst we were there :-(&nbsp;&nbsp; Franz Josef Glacier is a remnant of a much older, larger glacier which flowed from the alpine snowfields right to the sea. The glacier is over 12km (7.5mi) long extending into the rainforest just 5km (3mi) from the Franz Josef town.
            <img border="0" src="images/fox2.jpg" width="288" height="384" />
            Fox Glacier, just down the road. This one has much whiter face and was much more impressive than Franz Joseph.
		    <img border="0" src="images/sunset1.jpg" width="384" height="288" />
		    Jason was made to stop lots on the way home to take photos of the sunset - I've never seen it quite like this before.
