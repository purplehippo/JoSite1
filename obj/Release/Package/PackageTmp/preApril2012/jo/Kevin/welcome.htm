			<b>Welcome to the West Sussex Area Group of the N gauge society’s website. The club was formed in 1986 and we meet on the first and third Friday of every month from 7pm at Sompting village hall near Worthing.

			We use the modular system which means each member builds and owns their own board and we then join them together to form a bigger layout. The only requirements are :
		</p>

		<p class="mainText">
			<ul>
				<li><span class="mainText">The board is normally a 4 ft long straight board or a 2 ft or 3 ft square corner.</span></li>
				<li><span class="mainText">3 tracks have to be at the front of the board and meet club standards.</span></li>
				<li><span class="mainText">There are no points or isolators on the first two tracks, however they can be put on the third track.</span></li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p class="mainText">
			Apart from these rules anything can be done. It can be set anywhere in the world from Japan to the UK from desert scene to snow scene. It can just have three lines running though with no points or have a massive goods yard with lots of points. It can be an urban scene or rural scene.

				Our aim during exhibitions is to entertain the public young and old alike. We do this by making sure there is always something moving somewhere on the layout. We don’t run a timetable we just do what we want to do as long as we keep the trains moving. We do requests from the public and sometimes even let children run the trains. We are always willing to talk so if you have a question just ask.
				<br /><br />
				We receive some criticism because the scenery does not join up between modules
				<br /><br />
				However you can only take look at one module at a time. Secondly we can have more movement using the modular system. Thirdly we can run trains at their full length without looking over powering.
				<br /><br />
				An advantage of the modular system is that we can fit any shape or size the exhibition manger wants us to fit. We can have a circuit or end to end. The biggest size we ever done is 40ft x 30ft at the Brighton Modelworld.
