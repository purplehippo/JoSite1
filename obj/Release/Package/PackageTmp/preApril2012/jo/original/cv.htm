			<p>I am a Web Developer with nearly three years experience in a very broad role. I have <b>designed</b>, <b>created</b> and <b>tested</b> 2 versions of the company Intranet, and been responsible for the integration of a 3rd party document management system.  I support a number applications and provide constant improvements to the Intranet, according to the business's requirements.</p>
			<p style="padding-bottom: 0px;">Main technologies, at work:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>.NET (C#/VB - Visual Studio)</li>
				<li>ASP</li>
				<li>MSSQL/T-SQL</li>
				<li>HTML/CSS/XHTML</li>
				<li>Javascript</li>
				<li>A little XML/XSL</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Main technologies, from study/home:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PHP</li>
				<li>MySQL</li>
				<li>CFML (basic knowledge)</li>
				<li>A little Windows programming (C#)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In a previous life (after graduating), I created a few simple websites.  This was my first real meeting with the web, and where I learned the basics. Although very simple, I am fairly pleased with these, and remain fairly impressed (most unusual), so please take a look! (see &lsquo;links on this page&rsquo;).</p>
			<p>I graduated from <b>Loughborough University</b> in 2001, with a <b>BEng with honours</b> in Electronic and Electrical Engineering. I am continuing my studies (for fun!) with the <b>Open University</b> (more details can be found on the Open University page).</p>
			<p>Before starting in my current job, I worked and travelled in <b>New Zealand</b>. I managed to get a &lsquo;summer job&rsquo; related to my degree - helping to design the front end of a colour display unit.  This was a superb insight into the <b>running of international projects</b> in an engineering environment, as well as integrating with New Zealand life and culture. My six month planned stay extended to almost a year with constant contract extensions!</p>
