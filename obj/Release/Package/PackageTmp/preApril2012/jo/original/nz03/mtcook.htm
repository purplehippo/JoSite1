	<DIV CLASS="text">
		On March 1 2003, Jason took me to Mount Cook, in the Southern Alps. We left at 7am and went South, then West to Lake Tekapo.<BR><BR>
        <B>Lake Tekapo</B><BR>
        Golden tussock grows around the shores of this originally glacial valley. It has a stunning turquoise colour which comes from glacial sediment hanging in the water. The lake is 32 km long, 2000' (670m) above sea level, and 120m (360') deep at its deepest part. There is also one island in the middle.<BR><BR>

			The small, 'famous', "Chruch of the Good Sheppard", sits on the shores of Lake Tekapo. And no, they don't have any bells.<BR><BR><BR>

				Not much further along the road is Lake Pukaki, another huge turquoise lake.

				<B>Aoraki/Mount Cook and Tasman Glacier</B><BR>
				Aoraki is the Maori name for Mount Cook. Aoraki was given the name Mount Cook in 1851 (after Captain James Cook). Aoraki comes from an ancient myth of the Maori (one account says that the Gods turned the entire complement of a wrecked canoe into hills, the 'tallest' of the party was a child named Aoraki, who was sitting on the chief's shoulders. Another says that the mountain was named in honour of Aoraki, the first-born son of the sky father).<BR><BR>
				Aoraki's summit has 3 peaks, which are 3,754m (11,262') above sea level. In December 1991, an avalanche (including 10million cubic meters of snow, rocks and ice) lessened the height by 10m (30'). Mt Cook National Park 
                became so in 1953 and surrounds the hill. One third of its 70,000 hectares 
                (270 sq mi) are permanently covered in ice and snow.<BR><BR><BR>
                There are 72 named Glaciers, covering 40% of the park’s area.
                Tasman Glacier the largest in the world outside of polar regions and the 
                Himalayas. As one of 5 major glaciers in this region (Godley, 
                Murchison, Tasman, Hooker and Mueller), it has a river of ice 27km (17mi) long, up to 
                600m (12,000') thick and up to 3km (1.9mi) wide.<BR><BR>
                Near the base, where we tramped and seen below, is covered in an 
                average of 1m (3') of rocks, below which is the ice.

			I'm sure it's illegal, but I fished some ice out of Lake Tasman, at the bottom of Tasman Glacier. It was as clear as anything, very 
            very heavy and cold.<BR><BR><BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/ice.jpg" alt="Abel Tasman ice" width="288" height="384"><BR><BR>
			That's Mt Cook just beginning to hide behind a fluffy cloud, to the left of the ice.<BR><BR><BR>
			<DIV CLASS="text">
				The township of Mount Cook is a base for the DOC (department of conservation). It sits at 780m (2340') and is nothing special!!. 
                (in my humble opinion).<BR><BR><BR>
				<B>Oamaru and the Penguins</B><BR>
				On the way home, we stopped in Oamaru. Oamaru is also known as "The Whitestone City" because much of it is built from local cream-coloured limestone. The town originated as a port, opened in 1874. After this boom in the late 19th century, the town dwindled, only to be revived over the recent years. In November, the town is host to a penny-farthing race around the streets.<BR><BR>
                Oamaru is probably best know for its two penguin colonies (the Blue and Yellow Eyed penguins). The Blue penguins are the smallest and are found along the coasts of New Zealand and south Australia. They have white chests and bellies and have a bright stripe of indigo-blue from head to tale down their backs. Just before dusk, when the parents return to feed their chicks, they 'queue' away from the shore - gathering enough numbers to swim to shore. The chicks chatter loudly when they hear the 'quack' of this lot out at sea. The returners spend some time re-oiling their feathers with oil which is dispersed from the top of the tail, before moving on to front their chicks. The Yellow Eyed penguins come ashore in late afternoon, and nest in fewer numbers than the 44 Blue penguins we saw come ashore. They are an endangered species and only 23 nest here at Bushy Head.
			</DIV><BR>

			It was too dark to take any quick snaps of the Blue penguins, but if you look REALLY closely, there is a Yellow Eyed penguin (they are an endangered species after all) in the centre of this picture (look for his little footprints!):<BR><BR><BR>

			The seal just for you James :-) I think you can see it.<BR><BR><BR>
