<h2>Work (!?)</h2>
<p>
I am an Analyst Developer.  Most recently within a global life insurance company, and previously for a travel company.
</p>
<h3>Outline</h3>
<p>
I have been wholly responsible for an intranet, to provide crews with flight information and conformance regulations.  I gathered requirements, designed, built, tested, deployed and suported the intranet (front-end and back-end) independently.
</p>
<p>
For three years, I have worked within a team to develop a large .NET web project.  Again, requirements were very diverse and I have gained experience of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>functional specification writing through to business sign-off</li>
    <li>developing the application with VB.net, AJAX, Javascript, HTML, CSS; and approaches with generics, interfaces, LINQ, singletons</li>
    <li>using 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools such as CodeSmith (to dynamically create VB classes based on database and documentation for the database tables/storedprocedures), Telerik/OpenAccess ORM, and the AjaxControlToolkit</li>
    <li>responsible for integrating my own database requirements with existing database - which is also used by a 3<sup>rd</sup> party Java application</li>
    <li>creating test data and test methods for re-deploying the database and ensuring code changes do not affect other required functionality</li>
    <li>complying with compliance regulations within the financial (life insurance) industry</li>
</ul>

<p>
I also have experience of project managing the integration and bespoke modifications of a 3<sup>rd</sup> party document management, memo distribution and invoice scanning system. Functionality from which I integrated into the company's existing systems and Intranet.
