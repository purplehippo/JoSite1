            <h2>THE BANKS PENINSULAR</h2>
		    <p>
    		    A quick day trip around the exploded volcano of the Banks Peninsular. Just about managed to stop at most of the Bays on the North side on my way to Akaroa to the East...

            At the foot of the foothills ('behind' which is the Peninsular), the capital of Canterbury. Mmmm. See the 
            hustle and bustle!!. Christchurch's Port of Lyttelton.

            Following the north 'roads' around. This is a small tree (twig) in 'The Allandale Reserve', just outside of Governor's Bay.

            OK. I'm trying to be artistic (Allandale Reserve again). I have some really cool pix of this trip. But they're too big to go here :-(

            Wahoo. My mo'a. :-)
            <img src="images/akaroa/carView.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="A view" />
            Hm. That's better. More view, less mo'a.
            <img src="images/akaroa/sun.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Random field with sillouettes" />
            I did get a funny look from the guy (with a sheep and a dog) on a quad bike as I pulled over to take a photo of.... well, there wasn't actually anything there!.
            <img src="images/akaroa/roadSign.jpg" width="288" height="384" alt="Daft road sign, warning me after the event..." />
            Thanks... there wasn't a sign at the end I came in from. If you can't read it, it says 'Narrow road limited passing not suitable for towing or caravans' (no kidding). A major junction just here too (well, a 3-way sign post, with 8-9 pointy wooden bits (most of which said 'no exit' underneath)). Somewhere around Pigeon Bay.
            <img src="images/akaroa/theEdge.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="A view of the edge..." />
            I didn't make a habit of trying to prove the uselessness of the roads, but this came with a view  :-)

            Can't at the moment remember the name of this Maori village (yes, you can see ALL of it). It's just East (South-East?) of the main town of Akaroa. The French tried to settle here, and the town tries to pretend to be French. The British soon took over though, to make Canterbury and Christchurch (and New Zealand) the English speaking land it is today. (Go the Poms).
