            <h2>NEW ZEALAND</h2>
		    <h4>November 2002</h4>
		    Akaroa lies to the east of Christchurch on the Banks peninsular. It's on the otherside of the sea, on the right.
  	        <img border="0" src="images/akaroaview1.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Akaroa" />
		    <h4>Christmas day 2002</h4>
		    Need I say more??&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Fantastic weather, not depicted too well by my cheap digital camera.
	        <img border="0" src="images/chchw.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="View of Christchurch from the hills" />
		    It's west Christchurch, I live (and work) in there somewhere...

	        This is (more or less) the same photo, taken in the dark! (7 March 2003). If the car didn't shake for the full 10 second duration, it wouldn'a been so fuzzy!.
	        <h4>January 19 2003</h4>
		    Fancy a swim in the Pacific??
		    <img border="0" src="images/pacific.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Eleanor and myself going for a swim" />
		    Me and the other Pom, Eleanor, at North Beach.
		    <h4>February 18 2003</h4>
		    At the pub after ringing. This doesn't usually happen, but as it was my birthday, a few people stayed till almost 10 o'clock!! :-)  Thanks for the drinks guys :-)
       	    <img border="0" src="images/birthday.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="My birfday bash!!" />
       	    l to r: Dudley, Tanja, Midge, Robbie, Jim, Pat, Mike, Jo and Karen. My house mate Shar took the photo.

		    Obviously, this page is far from done - I can only do it from work, when no-one's looking, or it's coming up to 6. I'm working on it though. :-)
