            <h2>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</h2>
            <p>
    		    Seadni (emphasis on the e)... There's not a lot to say about Sydney. I'm quite proud to say that I managed to take 217 photos. Most of which are 99% dark, or the same as the one before, but with different buttons on my camera pressed. Anyways, here are some:

	        <h4>The "Coat Hanger"... (Sydney Harbour Bridge)</h4>
	        Starting in December 1926, the bridge took 8 years to build, including the railway line. The foundations are set in sandstone and are 12m (39') deep, anchoring tunnels are 36m (118') long and dug into rock at each end. The arch spans 503m (1650'), and the deck is 59m (194') above sea level. Hinges in the arch allow the steel to expand and contract in response to wind and temperature changes. The total cost of the bridge was $A13.5m ($NZ15.03m, GBP5.29), paid off in 1988. Initial costs were 2c for a horse and rider, cars are now $2, which is paying for the building of a tunnel.<br /><br />
			Seen from The Rocks area of town.

	        <h4>The Opera House</h4>
	        There it is, from the Royal Botanic Gardens.<br />
	        Located at Bennelong Point, the opera house is the brain-child of Eugene Goossens, the conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 1947. Designed through a competition by Danish-man, Jorn Utson in 1957. Construction began in March 1959 and officially opened in October 1973.

	        Our 'not going to the ringing dinner dinner'. We all went to a restaurant in Chinatown, had a fantastic time and spent far less money&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)&nbsp;See also the <a href="caption.htm">Caption competition</a>!<br />

	        See... we were having a good time.
	        <img src="images/downView.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="180 degrees down from the AMP Tower, Sydney" />
	        From up the AMP tower (250m, 750').

	        This one of the reasons I didn't like Sydney - crowded, stuffy...
