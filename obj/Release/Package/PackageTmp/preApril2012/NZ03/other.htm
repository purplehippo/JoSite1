            <h2>HERE 'N' THERE, DAY POTTERING</h2>
		    <h4>21 June 2003 Methven</h4>		
            The closest 'town' to Mt Hutt - the skifield for the townies of Christchurch. The 'most interesting thing in Methven', according to my guide book, was the 19c Anglican church. I found a small wooden building behind some trees, I think that was it. Maybe it's steeped in a 100 years of history, but it was closed...
		    <img src="images/other/bigAl.jpg" width="379" height="284" alt="Big Al in Methven" />
            This was the next most interesting thing - named after you Al! <b>:-)</b>
            <img src="images/other/limeWorks.jpg" width="379" height="284" alt="Diagram of how Buxton Lime Kilns work" />
            Buxton Lime Kilns, located near a non-place called Clearwater, in the Mt Sumner area (south of Methven)
            <img src="images/other/shoes.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="A fence full of shoes" />
            Anyone lost a shoe? I know I keep banging on about these places being in the middle of nowhere, but this was too. I drove a 100ks for over 15 mins, stopped, turned around twice, took piccies (and of the Lamas in the field) and left - before seeing anyone. Aparently, there's a bra one near Dunedin.
		
		    <h4>14 June 2003 St Nicholas Park to Taylor's Mistake</h4>
            <img src="images/other/sumner.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="A view of Sumner" />
            Small suburb of Christchurch nestled on the Port Hill (Sumner). The city scrapers are seen on the flat, just before they go hiding behind the hill. The spit of land on the right is not attached to the bit on the left - and it's a LONG way round! Castle rock (the one in the sea) is falling down <b>:-(</b>
		
		    <h4>6 July Snow on the Port Hills</h4>
		    It also snowed in the city - I have been told that that happened 20 years ago too. After the warmest June in 150 years too (we had a day of 23 degrees - it is mid winter).
            <img src="images/other/canopy.jpg" width="288" height="384" alt="SNOW!!  On the Port Hills :o)  It's JULY!!!" />
            You may have noticed, I like snow... The summit road was closed, so I had to go for a walk. Fell over a few times, but no-one'll recognise me and it's all part of the fun.
            <img src="images/other/joSnow.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Me in the snow" />
		    Some dodgy character who needs a haircut.
		
		    <h4>12 July 2003 Little River</h4>
		    Good for ice cream. A re-built station (disused) after it burned down. Located on the main road to Akaroa, on the south of the Banks Peninsular .
            <img src="images/other/icecream.jpg" width="288" height="384" alt="My ice cream on the Banks Peninsular" />
            Mmmm. Ice cream. Mid winter treat <b>:-)</b> I don't get this for 80p at home do I??. It's caramel on the top, orange and chocolate chip and cookies and cream on the bottom.
            <img src="images/other/tree.jpg" width="288" height="384" alt="A tree on the Banks Peninsular" />
            This is a tree, a very old, original tree. His friends were made into houses and used to cover this whole area.
        
		    <h4>13 July 2003 Castle Hill (1/2 way to Arthur's Pass)</h4>
		    Didn't intend to go this far, but fancied a closer look at the mountains...
		    <img src="images/other/snowMist.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="My misty image in the snow" />
            Remember the <a href="west.htm">mist photo</a>?? This is the same place, in winter.
            Behind is the 'Kura Tawhiti Conservation Area' of the Waimakariri Region. Note: Kura Tawhiti means Castle Hill.
            <img src="images/other/sheep.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="WooHoo...  Some sheep!" />
            Finally, some Kiwi sheep...
