                The cathedral stands in the square, beside that ghastly millennium thing. This photo was taken just before Christmas and before that tree on the left blew down in a puff of gales.

            Most of the ringers at the cathedral look like this. Thanks to our visitor who took it for us :-)

            <h4>Papanui</h4>
            We also have a gang at Papanui, (un)fortunately I had to take this photo, apologies for its poor quality - it was the middle of the night and I've had to doctor this photo, just so you can see people! :-(&nbsp; :

            <h4>My first quarter! :-)</h4>
            The first 1/4 in Christchurch for a very long time, and my first ever as conductor (1st attempt <b>:o)</b>). I'm quite pleased with myself because calling is only something I learned whilst here in NZ. This is the band (and we rock):

            The comment to me afterwards being "That's the first time I've seen you smile after
            a touch!". I can't be that bad, surely? - I just think there's always room for improvement.
