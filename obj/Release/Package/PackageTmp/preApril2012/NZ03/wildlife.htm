            <h2>ORANA WILDLIFE PARK</h2>
		    Anna, Shar (housie mates) and I went to <a href="http://www.oranawildlifepark.co.nz" target="resource">Orana Wildlife Park</a>, McLeans Island, Christchurch on Easter Monday, 21 April 2003. 
            Orana is an open range wildlife Park with the design reflecting the animals' natural habitats. <b>Orana</b> is a Maori word for welcome or place of refuge.<br /><br />
            Unfortunately, due to slow modems, I've only put a few pix up. There are fab photos of Turtles, Zebras, Emus, Bulls, Camels, Reptiles, Springboks, Ostriches, Giraffes, Ring Tailed Lemurs and Black and White Lemurs missing  :-( <br /><br />
            We paid our pennies, well, gave away all our cents, and went for a wonder.

	        Meer Cats. OK, so animals is animals - you should know what they are. But they're all cute. Just like...??
	        <img src="images/kanga.jpg" width="288" height="384" alt="Kangaroo" />
	        Kanga is a Red Kangaroo. Even though he's grey.
	        <img src="images/lionCubs.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Lion cubs" />
	        The lion mum being protective of her 'ikkle cubs. Arrrrr.
	        <img src="images/rhino.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Rhino" />
		    Mmmmm. Yummy mud.
	        <img src="images/leopard.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Leopard" />
	        After a quick sock chase (put on for the spectators), time for a quick prowl around.
	        <img src="images/longTailMonkey.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Long Tail monkey" />
	        Hey, hey, we're the monkeys.... Long Tail Monkeys to be precise.
		    <img src="images/snake.jpg" width="288" height="384" alt="A snake" />
		    Yuk. What's this? Don't know what these, rare species have been fed. Not sure I want any. Perhaps it's a hang-over??
    	    <img src="images/terra.jpg" width="360" height="280" alt="Shar's cat, Terra" />
    	    Yep, this looks terra-torial (hahahaaa) and visious. I lost an eyebrow since I had this taken!!  :-)
