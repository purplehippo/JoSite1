            <h2>ANZAB, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</h2>
    
            <h4>25 - 27 April</h4>
            The 'Australia and New Zealand Association of Bell Ringers' annual 'get together'. This page needs a little work (coz I can't remember the names of all the churches). It was a very good weekend. I think I rang at all the churches (except the one at Castlereagh). If it wasn't such a good weekend, I might have had 1/2 a chance at remembering some of the names!...
            <br /><br />
            The striking competition was held at Christchurch St Lawrence next door to my YHA. NZ came 3rd, but we should have come first!. Perhaps if we had been ringing Stedman (like the judges thought), then we may have done better!! Our fab band was Mike Clayton (c),&nbsp; Daniel Richards, Jo Faircloth, David X, Chris Y and Karen Robinson.
    
            <h4>Thursday</h4>
            <img src="images/Singleton.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Singleton" />
            The Thursday (24/4). This is the first church of my 'weekend'. Merely 5 minutes after I arrived in Sydney, I was on the bus to here (about 3 hours drive away). It's in Singleton and is North West-ish of Sydney.

            Maitland, 'down the road' from Singleton. It didn't fit in any other way.
    
            <h4>Friday</h4>
            <img src="images/FriFirst.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="" />
            On the bus trip round the Sydney suburbs, lots of places with silly names.
            <br /><br />
            'First thing' Friday morning. St Marks, Darling Point - where that film was filmed - the Ozzy one with the church... Elton John also got married here... (apparently). It was a very small, picturesque church, perched on a small mound. The ringing room was tiny, and we were only allowed up in 8's! (one for each bell!).

            Last tower on Friday<br />If anyone knows anything, let me know...  :-)

            <h4>Saturday</h4>

            St Andrews?

            <h4>Sunday</h4>

            <img src="images/sunBBQ.jpg" width="288" height="384" alt="Randwick for the BBQ" />
            Had to take a bus here, in the POURING rain. It's in Randwick, the farewell BBQ 
            was here. Rang some interesting stuff, gsire trips, stedman trips... had a small bell screwed to the centre of the floor. Everyone kept tripping over that!!&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)
            <img src="images/stMarysRain.jpg" width="288" height="384" alt="St Mary's in the rain" />
            The Catholic Cathedral of St Mary's. Same day as the BBQ - more rain. See that fountain in the distance (not the water pouring out of the flower bed). I walked through that, mistaking it for the pavement! Guess it serves me right for bouncing up and down and trotting backwards to get the slow-coaches to hurry along! (You know who you are, Karen and Garth). <b>:-)</b>.
