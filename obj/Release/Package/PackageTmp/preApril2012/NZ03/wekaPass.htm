            <h2>THE WEKA PASS RAILWAY</h2>
            <p>
                YAY...  <b>:-)</b> Finally, a hot throbbing monster. Weka Pass, about 40 minutes (1hr according to the guide books) north of Christchurch - a steam train... It cost me just $12 (just over 4 squid) for my ride in the cattle carriage. It was a novelty to be without any safety at all in the open truck and rather chilly at times when the sun went in.
                <br /><br />
		        The scenery was quite something, as the train heads up into the mountains. Thought I took a piccy of the view (I'm looking for it!!).
                <br /><br />
		        The two hour trip was amazing, not just for the scenery, but also because the sight of a steam train is obviously a novelty for most Kiwis and 9/10 drivers on the road blew their horns, swerved a bit and waved.

		    The first steaming loco in over 6 1/2 months... This is the A428.

		    I thought this was kwite cool. Bit spotter-y though. They stopped at a random place, where everybody walks all over the lines and up the bank, while the train goes back down the hill and round the corner, before puffing past to have its piccy took.

	        Mmmm. Extension prospects at the end station of Waikari. You can just about pick out the hazy Southern Alps in the background.

		    That's it, that's the station...

		    Appropriately named 'Frog Rock'.

		    The tracks follow the road for most of the trip - this I had to wait 25 minutes for! It was only a couple of k's up the road. Didn't realise the hill was that steep!!

		    Just some beach at the northern end of Christchurch...
