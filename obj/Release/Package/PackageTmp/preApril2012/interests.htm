            <h2>Bell Ringing</h2>
            <div class="contentBox">
                <p>
                Ringing is my main interest, which I usually do 3-4 times a week, and on Sundays. It's an interesting art, that I have been doing for nearly 20 years (hmmm, wish I hadn't written that!!  I started young, you understand...). I enjoy ringing at different churches, meeting people, learning the methods, and most of all, teaching others how to learn methods.

                I once helped to augment a tower from 8 bells to 12 and am the steeple keeper at East Grinstead, as well as a committee member for the East Grinstead District Guild (EGDG).

            <h2>Steam Trains</h2>
            <div class="contentBox">
                <p>Before I moved to West Sussex, I spent some time with friends on the Kent and East Sussex Railway, where I did a little engine cleaning, firing and steam raising.</p>
                <p>I have since become involved in the restoration of the Southern S15 class, 847 (a 4-6-0 Manusell steam locomotive), based at the Bluebell Railwas.  This involves taking it apart and putting it back together again; all shiney and working! I show up once a week, and do anything from steam cleaning, to needle gunning, to cleaning and painting.</p>
                <p>My favourite loco by miles is the U Class... The result of 13 years and over £200,000 work by the Maunsell Locomotive Society (before I joined :o( ). A full restoration report can be found on the Maunsell Locomotive Society website.</p>
                <p>I am now a company director of the MLS :o)</p>
