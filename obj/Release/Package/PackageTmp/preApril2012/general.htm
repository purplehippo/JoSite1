<h2>Work history</h2>
<div class="contentBox">
    <p>
I am a Web Developer with nearly three years experience in a very broad role. I have designed, created and tested 2 versions of the company Intranet, and been responsible for the integration of a 3rd party document management system. I support a number applications and provide constant improvements to the Intranet, according to the business's requirements.

Main technologies, at work:

    * .NET (C#/VB - Visual Studio)
    * ASP
    * MSSQL/T-SQL
    * HTML/CSS/XHTML
    * Javascript
    * A little XML/XSL

Main technologies, from study/home:

    * PHP
    * MySQL
    * CFML (basic knowledge)
    * A little Windows programming (C#)

In a previous life (after graduating), I created a few simple websites. This was my first real meeting with the web, and where I learned the basics. Although very simple, I am fairly pleased with these, and remain fairly impressed (most unusual), so please take a look! (see ‘links on this page’).

<h2>Education</h2>

        I graduated from Loughborough University in 2001, with a BEng with honours in Electronic and Electrical Engineering. I am continuing my studies (for fun!) with the Open University (more details can be found on the Open University page).

Before starting in my current job, I worked and travelled in New Zealand. I managed to get a ‘summer job’ related to my degree - helping to design the front end of a colour display unit. This was a superb insight into the running of international projects in an engineering environment, as well as integrating with New Zealand life and culture. My six month planned stay extended to almost a year with constant contract extensions!
