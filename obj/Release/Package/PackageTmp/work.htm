<h2>Work (!?)</h2>
<p>
I am an analyst developer and technical lead.  Currently for a large pensions provider, and previously for a global life insurance company and an airline.
</p>
<h3>Outline</h3>
<p>
I am technical lead on a very large project configuring workflows for a civil service pension provider.  The software is bespoke, based on VB.  The configuration is applied to an existing &lsquo;package&rsquo; and product, written by a different team in ASP.NET and VB6.   The provider has 2.5 million members and data is held across over 800 MSSQL tables.
</p>
<p>
I am responsible for mainly the generic components - those shared across all 100+ workflows in use by both the admin (pensions administrations) and payroll (pensions payments) teams.
</p>
<p>
I have taken on a lot of the defect management, and take part responsibility for ensuring the admin workflow team (about 6 of us) are able to efficiently fix over 1500 defects raised to us from system and UAT testing.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, whilst I'm loving the role, the team leadership, extra responsibilities, the people and even the work - it has taken me away from web applications development.  For that reason, I keep in the description from my previous roles, below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Web applications roles</h3>
<p>
I am usually involved in all aspects of a coding project, even conception on some small projects.
</p>
<p>
For eight years, I worked within teams to develop large .NET web applications (C# / VB and front-end coding), with legacy code in Javascript, ASP and a little PHP:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>functional specification writing through to business sign-off</li>
    <li>developed applications with VB/C#.net, AJAX, Javascript, HTML(5), CSS(3), jQuery; and approaches with generics, interfaces, LINQ-to_SQL, singletons</li>
    <li>managed interfaces and queries to/from MSSQL, and even designed the database from scratch</li>
    <li>used 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools such as CodeSmith (to dynamically create VB classes based on database and documentation for the database tables/storedprocedures), Telerik/OpenAccess ORM, and the AjaxControlToolkit</li>
    <li>was responsible for integrating my own database requirements with existing database - which is also used by a 3<sup>rd</sup> party Java application</li>
    <li>created test data and test methods for re-deploying the database and ensuring code changes do not affect other required functionality</li>
    <li>complied with compliance regulations (for application and data protection / money laundering) within financial (life insurance and pensions) industries</li>
    <li>maintain and debug front-end bugs using developer tools, such as 'F12' on Chrome and IE, Fiddler; and SQL bugs using SQL Server Profiler</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally to my role as a lead, I have experience of project managing the integration and bespoke modifications of a 3<sup>rd</sup> party document management, memo distribution and invoice scanning system. Functionality from which I integrated into the company's existing systems and Intranet.
