                    Udacity is a fantastic, brand new online learning resource.  Its first courses were CS101 - Building a Search Engine and CS373 - Building a Robotic Car; both offered as a 7 week course in February 2012.
                    <span class="quoteOpen"><span class="quote">We believe university-level education can be both high quality and low cost. Using the economics of the Internet, we've connected some of the greatest teachers to hundreds of thousands of students in almost every country on Earth. Udacity was founded by three roboticists who believed much of the educational value of their university classes could be offered online for very low cost. A few weeks later, over 160,000 students in more than 190 countries enrolled in our first class, "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence." The class was twice profiled by the New York Times and also by other news media. Now we're a growing team of educators and engineers, on a mission to change the future of education.<span class="cite"><a href="http://www.udacity.com/us" target="_blank">Udacity</a> (Apr '12)</span></span></span>

                <p>&ldquo;Learn key concepts in computer science and build a search engine like google!&rdquo;</p>
                <p>OK - not quite!  But it does provide an introduction to computing, using Python; and outlines how to code a web crawler with basic page ranking of popular pages.</p>
